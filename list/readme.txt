My program was made to return information to you about a directed graph. Input is in the form "1-2,2-3" and also supports unconnected nodes "1-2,2-3,4", user input is checked with a regular expression to validate it.

The program prints out a visual representation of the graph in the form (a -> b)(a -> c) for each node, it will also print out the total number of nodes and edges in the graph. It also calculates the average number of edges per node rounded to 1 decimal place.

It also checks if the graph is a tree, my program assumes the first node inputted is the root of the tree.
