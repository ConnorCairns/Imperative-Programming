I set out to make a program that would be able to take 3 types as inputs: char, int and float. I wanted to parse the input for each type separately so I could check base cases for each type such as a float being entered with multiple decimal points.

The char type handles ints from -128 to 127 and also single letters. All char inputs will output the sign, representation in binary and in hex. For ints 0-9 and all single letters the ASCII value will be printed.

Int and float types will output the sign and 32 bit binary representation.

There are comments in the code to explain further.
